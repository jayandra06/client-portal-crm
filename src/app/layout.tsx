/**
 * Theme Resolver Phase B — server-side first render.
 *
 * The root layout is the one layout above every Aqenra surface (public
 * site, auth, /privacy, /terms, the staff app, Portal, Platform Admin —
 * confirmed by audit: none of them has its own competing layout), so
 * this is the single correct place to emit the pre-paint script.
 *
 * `data-theme="light"` here is a generic, hardcoded SSR default — NOT
 * read from the `aqenra_theme` cookie. This is a deliberate correction
 * from an earlier draft that called `cookies()` here: this app's own
 * installed Next.js docs (node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/
 * preventing-flash-before-hydration.md, "Storing the theme in a
 * cookie") explicitly warn that reading a cookie in the root layout
 * "opts the entire app out of static prerendering" — confirmed
 * empirically too (a build before this fix showed every route,
 * including previously-static /privacy and /terms, become dynamic).
 * The same doc's recommended fix is exactly this: keep the layout
 * static with a generic default, and let the inline pre-paint script
 * (below) do 100% of the cookie reading/correcting, for all four
 * ThemeMode values — not just System/Automatic. See
 * pre-paint-script.ts's own doc comment for why that script already
 * handles explicit Light/Dark too (it always has — nothing to change
 * there).
 *
 * `suppressHydrationWarning` is required on `<html>` for the same
 * documented reason: the pre-paint script may have already changed
 * `data-theme` before React hydrates, and without this prop React's
 * hydration would silently revert the DOM back to this literal "light"
 * default the moment it reconciles the `<html>` element — exactly the
 * bug this fixes (confirmed via a real failing E2E run before this was
 * added: Playwright showed the cookie and React's own state correctly
 * resolving to "dark" while the actual `data-theme` attribute stayed
 * "light", reverted by hydration).
