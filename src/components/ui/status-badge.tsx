// relative ordering (bg-gray-100/text-gray-700 read stronger than
// bg-gray-200/text-gray-500 did not; the two were already close — muted
// is kept the quieter of the two via surface-recessed + text-muted vs.
// neutral's surface-muted + text-secondary).

  // WON/LOST reuse the same success/danger tones every other terminal-
  // outcome pair in this map already does (COMPLETED/CANCELLED,
  // ACCEPTED/REVOKED). No collision with ClientStatus's own LEAD entry
  // above — that's a Client.status value ("LEAD" meaning "an unqualified

  // terminal outcome" success tone; DECLINED mirrors LOST/REVOKED/
  // CANCELLED's own "negative terminal outcome" danger tone. CONVERTED is
  // a derived-only Quote state (see src/lib/quotes/status.ts) that
  // deliberately shares APPROVED's success tone — every converted Quote
  // was necessarily approved first, so this is still the same positive
  // outcome, not a new one — distinguished from a plain APPROVED badge by
  // its own label text alone (see quote-status-badge.tsx), the same
  // "color shared, label text is what actually distinguishes them"
  // precedent this map already uses for NEW/PLANNING/TODO/DRAFT sharing

  // non-urgent holding state (neutral); RESOLVED mirrors DONE/COMPLETED's
  // own positive-outcome success tone; CLOSED mirrors ARCHIVED/EXPIRED's

  // meaning values above). Mirrors ON_HOLD's own "temporarily inactive,
  // not a terminal/negative outcome" warning tone at the equivalent tier.
  PAUSED: "warning",

  // Contracts Phase 2 (Staff UI) — ContractStatus's own TERMINATED value
  // (DRAFT/SENT/ACCEPTED/ACTIVE/EXPIRED above already cover every other
  // stored or derived Contract status). A terminated Contract is a
  // resolved, wound-down business relationship, not a negative outcome
  // like CANCELLED/DECLINED/REVOKED (those keep "danger") — mirrors
  // CLOSED/ARCHIVED's own "wound down, no longer active" muted tone
  // instead.
  TERMINATED: "muted",
