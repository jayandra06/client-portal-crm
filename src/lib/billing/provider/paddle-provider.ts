 * flagged: `createCheckoutSession` no longer returns Paddle's own
 * `transaction.checkout.url` (which only resolves to a working page once
 * this app additionally hosts a Paddle.js-enabled "Default Payment
 * Link" — a separate, uncertain setup step) and instead returns this
 * app's own `/billing/checkout` bridge page URL, carrying the new
 * transaction's id — see `buildCheckoutBridgeUrl` below and
 * `src/app/billing/checkout/page.tsx` for the client-side half of this
 * bridge. The real, server-only Paddle implementation of
 * `BillingProviderAdapter` (`./types.ts`). As of E2.6 (Paddle Provider
 * Resolver Activation), this adapter IS wired into
 * `getBillingProviderAdapter()` (`./provider.ts`) — that resolver
 * activates it automatically whenever `getPaddleProviderConfig()`
 * returns a complete, valid configuration, and falls back to the
 * fail-closed unconfigured adapter otherwise (see that file's own doc
 * comment for the exact priority order). No real Paddle account exists

 * issue #30 ("Webhook time validation error") reports the 5-second
 * default rejecting genuinely valid deliveries, resolved for that
 * integrator by widening to 10 seconds. This app's own deployment target
 * (a Vercel serverless Next.js route) is exactly the kind of environment
 * where a cold start plus normal network latency can plausibly eat a
 * multi-second chunk of a 5-second budget on its own, before Paddle's
 * own delivery latency is even considered — a false rejection here would
 * silently drop a legitimate event (Paddle does retry failed
 * deliveries, but that's an operational band-aid, not something to
 * design around). 30 seconds keeps meaningful margin while staying
 * inside the "5-30 seconds is a typical, reasonable range" guidance
 * commonly given for this kind of check, and is a small concession
 * given this route's own independent, unconditional idempotency
 * guard — every event is deduped on `WebhookEvent.providerEventId` via a
 * real unique-constraint (`P2002`) catch regardless of how fresh its
 * timestamp was judged to be, so a replayed-but-still-within-tolerance
 * event can never be reapplied even once accepted here; this constant's
 * real job is rejecting a *stale* signed payload, not being the sole
 * anti-replay control.
 *
 * Exported so tests reference this exact value rather than a hardcoded
 * magic number, and so it's trivially auditable if this reasoning ever
 * needs revisiting. Still NOT yet exercised against a real Paddle
 * sandbox delivery — see this PR's own report for why that's flagged as
