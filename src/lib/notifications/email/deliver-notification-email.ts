// MVP allowlist — evaluated per type, not per Activity, since one Activity
// can already fan out to several Notification rows of the same type (see
// INVOICE_STATUS_CHANGED's one-to-many rule) and every one of them makes
// its own independent email decision.
//
//   ROLE_CHANGED                 yes — directly affects what the recipient can do
//   OWNERSHIP_TRANSFERRED        yes — high-stakes, rare, worth an email
//   MEMBER_REMOVED               yes — the recipient may no longer be checking the app at all
//   INVITATION_ACCEPTED          NO  — the inviter is already active in the app; an
//                                      in-app badge is enough, an email is low value
//   PORTAL_INVITATION_ACCEPTED   yes — useful for the staff inviter, same reasoning as above
//   INVOICE_STATUS_CHANGED       yes, but noted — recipients are every OWNER/ADMIN in the
//                                      org (§4.2's one one-to-many fan-out rule); this can
//                                      mean an email to several people per status change.
//                                      Deliberately follows the existing Notification rows
//                                      rather than inventing a narrower email-only rule — a
//                                      digest or opt-out is a real follow-up, not MVP.
//   MENTIONED                    yes — a direct, personal "you specifically are wanted"
//                                      signal, the same reasoning as ROLE_CHANGED/
//                                      OWNERSHIP_TRANSFERRED (docs/comments-architecture.md
//                                      §5). A bare comment with no @mention never reaches
//                                      this allowlist at all — it never produces a
//                                      Notification in the first place.
//   SUBSCRIPTION_ACTIVATED       yes — docs/billing-architecture.md §17's own table:
//   PAYMENT_FAILED                     every billing event notifies the OWNER by both
//   SUBSCRIPTION_CANCELED              channels — these are consequential, low-volume,
//   PLAN_CHANGED                       OWNER-only events an email is clearly worth for.
