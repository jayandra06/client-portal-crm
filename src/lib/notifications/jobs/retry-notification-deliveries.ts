 * a JS predicate mid-query); this function is what those clauses are
 * verified against, both in unit tests (the logic) and integration tests
 * (that the SQL actually matches it).
 *
 * PENDING is always eligible (never actually persisted by the request-
 * bound path today, but the claim logic still honors it — see deliver-
 * notification-email.ts's own note on why the enum value exists anyway).
 * FAILED is eligible only under the attempt ceiling AND once nextAttemptAt
 * has passed (or was never set). PROCESSING is only eligible if its
 * lockedAt is older than staleLockMs — a fresh PROCESSING row belongs to
 * a run that's still (or was, moments ago) actively working it. SENT and
 * SKIPPED are never eligible — both are terminal.

/**
 * Background retry for notification email delivery — the counterpart to
 * deliverNotificationEmails' request-bound first attempt (src/lib/
 * notifications/email/deliver-notification-email.ts). Meant to be called
 * from a cron-triggered Route Handler, never from user request handling:
 * `now`/`limit` are caller-supplied so every run (and every test) is
 * deterministic, and there is no session/Membership/cookie dependency of
 * any kind — this only ever reads/writes NotificationDelivery + the
 * Notification/User/NotificationPreference rows it points at.
 *
 * Scope, deliberately: this only retries deliveries that *already have* a
 * NotificationDelivery row (PENDING or FAILED-under-ceiling), plus stale
 * PROCESSING rows left behind by a crashed previous run. It does not scan
 * for Notification rows with no delivery row at all — every notification-
 * producing call site already calls deliverNotificationEmails synchronously
 * post-commit (Stage 6/7), so a missing row would mean that call never
 * even started (the request died before reaching it), which is a
 * different, rarer failure mode than "the attempt was made and failed."
 * Backfilling those is intentionally out of scope for this stage.
 *
 * Concurrency: claiming is a conditional updateMany (`WHERE status =
 * 'FAILED'/'PENDING'` or `WHERE status = 'PROCESSING' AND lockedAt < stale
 * threshold`) — Postgres evaluates each row's WHERE clause at the moment
 * that row's UPDATE actually executes, so if two job runs race for the
 * same row, only the one whose UPDATE commits first still sees the
 * expected starting status; the loser's WHERE no longer matches and its
 * update simply skips that row. The immediate re-query (`status =
 * 'PROCESSING' AND lockedAt = now`) is how each run learns exactly which
 * rows *it* just claimed, since `now` is unique per invocation.
