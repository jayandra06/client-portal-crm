/**
 * PGlite/PG-wire transaction-recovery facade — PGLITE_TEST_DB only, never
 * used in Production or ordinary development (see `createProductionPrismaClient`
 * below, byte-for-byte the same construction this file always used).
 *
 * Root cause this works around: the installed `@prisma/adapter-pg`
 * (7.9.1) releases its underlying pg-pool client unconditionally
 * (`client.release()`, no error argument) from both `PgTransaction.commit()`
 * and `.rollback()` — even when the transaction genuinely aborted. Since
 * pg-pool only destroys a connection released as unhealthy, an aborted
 * transaction's connection is recycled as if nothing happened. Under
 * PGlite's single-connection cap, the next query issued anywhere in this
 * process can then be handed a stale, wrongly-shaped result left over from
 * the aborted exchange (confirmed by direct reproduction).
 *
 * Design: a Proxy over a small, permanently-stable `overlay` object.
 * `get`/`has` check `overlay`'s own properties first — this is exactly
 * what lets `vi.spyOn(prisma, "$transaction")` (and Vitest's spy
 * machinery generally, which installs/restores via `Object.defineProperty`/
 * `Reflect.deleteProperty` on the object it's given) work completely
 * unmodified: those calls land on `overlay` via the Proxy's own default
 * (untrapped) behavior, and a subsequent `get` finds the installed mock
 * there before ever consulting the real client — a spy fully replaces
 * `$transaction` for the tests that install one (they simulate an
 * application-level rejection with no real connection involved, so there
 * is nothing for this facade to recover from), and disappears cleanly on
 * `mockRestore()`, after which real recovery resumes.
 *
 * When nothing is overlaid, every property/method forwards to a mutable
 * `currentClient`. `$transaction` is the one property this facade always
 * synthesizes itself (never delegated) when no spy has overlaid it: it
 * runs the callback against whichever client was current when the call
 * was made, and if it rejects, flags that exact client as needing
 * replacement.
 *
 * The replacement itself is deliberately LAZY, not immediate: a fresh
 * PrismaClient/pool is only ever constructed once every `$transaction`
 * call that was ever issued against the flagged client has itself
 * settled (a simple in-flight counter tracks this) — never while a
 * genuinely concurrent sibling call (e.g. two simultaneous accept-invite
 * calls racing each other via Promise.all) might still be using that same
 * physical connection. Constructing the new pool any earlier would open a
 * second live connection to PGlite's single-threaded socket server while
 * the first was possibly still mid-query — exactly the class of
 * cross-connection corruption this facade exists to prevent, not
 * reintroduce.
 *
 * A retired client is never `$disconnect()`'d in the same instant it's
 * replaced — proven necessary, not merely cautious: even a fire-and-forget
 * disconnect can still be mid-handshake with PGlite's own socket server at
 * the exact moment the freshly-constructed replacement pool opens its own
 * first connection, which is the identical single-threaded overlap this
 * whole facade exists to avoid (reproduced directly: disconnecting
 * immediately on rotation reintroduced a genuine "Cannot use a pool after
 * calling end" failure in a real concurrent-accept test). Instead, a
 * retired client is kept as `staleClient` — idle, unreferenced by any new
 * call — until the *next* rotation, at which point enough real time has
 * passed that it's disconnected safely, one generation behind. This
 * bounds simultaneously-open connections to at most two (current + one
 * stale) no matter how many rotations a single file causes, comfortably
 * inside PGlite's own `maxConnections` cap.
